<BOS> <horror> In the middle of a iced tea, two men discuss an encounter with a mysterious stranger, who turns out to be none other than the famous playwright Lawrence Ashcroft himself, whose play he has recently produced and is about his to star in. The stranger turns out to be Ashcroft's estranged wife Helen. She is not so displeased after hearing about it and insists that Helen might have had some influence on Lawrence, but insists that Lawrence is having serious difficulty understanding the strange stranger's motive for appearing at a theater where Lawrence stars; Helen may know that too; but this possibility does not prove to any of these men that his motives are a cause for anger.
